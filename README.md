Hi, I’m @jimgr921

I’m an electrical engineer with a lot of software modeling development back in the '80s and '90's.  My 
experience took me into Systems's Engineering, then into management.  Going into management is a painful 
trap that many engineers / developers find themselves falling into.  I am now a consulting program manager 
leading various developmnent, or engineering projects.  I lead using Agile, Scrum methodologies (even if 
the work is not software related).  I want to get back to doing what I love, most which is development.

I’m currently learning crypto development.
